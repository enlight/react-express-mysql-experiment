Project structure:

- src - contains the backend code, simple Express server that serves the bundled
        frontend, and also provides an API to create new orders, and to retrieve
        a JSON schema for orders.
- frontend - React app generated by create-react-app. In development mode the
             frontend is served by its own local server, requests that aren't
             handled by the frontend are proxied to the backend. In production
             mode the frontend is bundled with Webpack and served by the Express
             server.
